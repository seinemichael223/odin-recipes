<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Banana Bread Cake was one of the first things we baked that ended up being yummy.
</p>
<p>It tasted yummy, and of bananas. It requires bananas but the variety of the nearly-wilted type is suited best.
However, it is also possible to chuck a few into an oven and heat for 3 minutes to emulate a similar texture. Throw in vanilla extract and cinnamon and it somehow makes the final product better. Best baked as a present in a pinch.</p>
